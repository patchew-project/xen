How to enable early printk

Early printk can only be enabled if CONFIG_DEBUG=y. You may want to enable
it if you are debbuging code that executes before the console is
initialized.

Note that selecting this option will limit Xen to a single UART definition.
Attempting to boot Xen image on a different platform *will not work*, so this
option should not be enable for Xens that are intended to be portable.

Select one of the "UART drivers for early printk" in the "Debugging options" of
Kconfig. You will then need to set other options, which depends on the drivers
selected.

CONFIG_EARLY_UART_BASE_ADDRESS is a mandatory arguments, it is the base
physical address of the UART to use.

Other options depends on the driver selected:
  - 8250
    - CONFIG_EARLY_UART_8250_REG_SHIFT is, optionally, the left-shift to
      apply to the register offsets within the uart.
  - pl011
    - CONFIG_EARLY_UART_BAUD_RATE is, optionally a baud rate which should
      be used to configure the UART at start of day.

      Select CONFIG_EARLY_UART_INIT to have the option, if that's set to N
      then the code will not try to initialize the UART, so that bootloader
      or firmware settings can be used for maximum compatibility.
  - scif
    - CONFIG_EARLY_UART_SCIF_VERSION is, optionally, the interface version
      of the UART. Default to version NONE.

  - For all other uarts there are no additional options.

As a convenience it is also possible to select from a list of
predefined configurations via "Enable early printk for a specific platform
(deprecated)".

These settings are is hardcoded in xen/arch/arm/Kconfig.debug,
see there when adding support for new machines.

By default early printk is disabled.
